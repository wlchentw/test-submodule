                          NAND2.0
                ===============================

    NAND2.0 is a common nand driver which designed for accessing
different type of NANDs(SLC, SPI-NAND, MLC, TLC) on various OS. This
driver can work on mostly SoCs of Mediatek.

    Although there already has a common nand driver, it doesn't cover
SPI-NAND, and not match our IC-Verification's reqirement. We need
a driver that can be exten or cut easily.

    This driver is base on NANDX & SLC. We try to refactor structures,
and make them inheritable. We also refactor some operations' flow
principally for adding SPI-NAND support.

    This driver's architecture is like:

          Driver @LK/Uboot/DA...           |IC verify/other purposes
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
      partition       |        BBM         |
    -------------------------------------- |       extend_core
             nandx_core/core_io            |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
             nand_chip/nand_base           |
    -------------------------------------- |        extend_nfi
      nand_device     |    nfi/nfi_base    |

    Any block of above graph can be extended at your will, if you
want add new feature into this code, please make sure that your code
would follow the framework, and we will be appreciated about it.
