      Enable this to add support for MediaTek T-PHY driver,
      it supports physical layer functionality for usb2.0, usb3.0,
      PCIe and SATA, and meanwhile supports two version T-PHY which
      have different banks layout, the T-PHY with shared banks between
      multi-ports is first version, otherwise is second veriosn,
      so you can easily distinguish them by banks layout.
